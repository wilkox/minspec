[1 of 1050]	100 taxon, 1 assemblage, 10 reads, repeat #1
Run with '--help' for all options
STEP 1 - randomly generating 100 taxa
STEP 2 - select a subset of 1 taxa to be the assemblage
STEP 3 - simulating blast of 10 reads from the assemblage against the database of taxa

STEP 4 - processing the pseudo-blast output with minspecGLPSOL: GLPK LP/MIP Solver, v4.44

STEP 5 - comparing minspec-determined minimal set to actual assemblage
RESULTS:
False positive rate: %
False negative rate (including false negatives due to under-sampling of rare taxa): 0%
False negative rate (only including false negatives generated by minspec): 0% at autovalidate.pl line 36.
